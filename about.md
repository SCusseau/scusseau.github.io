### More Information

I’m a 28-year-old engineer based in Paris with a strong focus on .NET development, event-driven systems, and database optimization. My expertise spans PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MartenDB, and Quartz.NET, with a passion for clean code, robust exception handling, and efficient logging.

I enjoy solving complex problems, writing performant SQL queries, and building scalable APIs. Outside of work, I love hosting friends and exploring the city’s vibrant culture.

Feel free to connect for collaboration or to chat about tech!
